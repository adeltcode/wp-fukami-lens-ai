# WP Fukami Lens AI

WP Fukami Lens AI is an advanced AI integration plugin for WordPress, enabling not only Japanese spelling and grammar checking, but also deep, AI-powered search and question-answering over your site's content. By leveraging OpenAI and Anthropic APIs, the plugin allows you to interact with your site data in natural languageâ€”summarizing, searching, and extracting insights from posts and pages. It supports both the Classic Editor and Dashboard, and includes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) features for context-aware AI assistance with **LanceDB vector database** for efficient semantic search. 

This plugin is still under active development. 

## Features
- Japanese spelling and grammar checking using OpenAI or Anthropic APIs
- Deep semantic search and Q&A over your site's content using AI
- **LanceDB vector database integration** for efficient embedding storage and retrieval
- **Smart embedding duplicate checking** to avoid unnecessary API calls and reduce costs
- Proofreading metabox in the Classic Editor
- Dashboard AI Assistant widget (with RAG support)
- Semantic HTML processing for accurate context
- Token-based chunking and advanced tokenization (Docling/tiktoken)
- Per-post debug output for AI and chunking
- Settings page for API keys, models, and RAG options
- Python backend for chunking/tokenization (Docling or tiktoken)
- **Date range filtering** for content processing and search
- **Vector database management** with embedding storage and similarity search

## Requirements
- **WordPress 5.0+** (Classic Editor recommended for full proofreading features)
- **PHP 7.4+**
- **Python 3.8+** (for advanced chunking/tokenization)
- Python dependencies (install with `pip install -r python/requirements.txt`):
  - `docling` (preferred, for advanced chunking)
  - `tiktoken` (fallback chunking/tokenization)
  - `markdownify` (fallback HTML to Markdown)
  - `requests`
  - `lancedb` (for vector database)
  - `numpy`, `pandas`, `pydantic` (for LanceDB operations)
- OpenAI or Anthropic API key (set in plugin settings)

## Installation
1. Copy the `wp-fukami-lens-ai` folder to your WordPress `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```
   cd wp-content/plugins/wp-fukami-lens-ai/python
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Activate the plugin in the WordPress admin.
4. Go to **Settings > WP Fukami Lens AI** and enter your API key(s) and select your preferred model/provider.

## Usage
- **Proofreading:** Edit a post in the Classic Editor and use the "Proofread" button in the metabox.
- **AI Assistant:** Use the Dashboard widget to ask questions about your site content (optionally using RAG).
- **Deep Search/Q&A:** Ask complex questions about your site's content and get AI-generated answers, summaries, or insights.
- **LanceDB Management:** Use the LanceDB Manager to store embeddings and perform semantic search with automatic duplicate checking.
- **Debugging:** See per-post debug output (HTML, chunking, tokens) in the plugin's Python runner page.

## Advanced Features

### Cost Optimization with Embedding Duplicate Checking
The plugin includes smart duplicate checking for embeddings to minimize API costs:

- **Automatic Detection:** Before making OpenAI API calls, the system checks if embeddings already exist for the requested posts
- **Selective Processing:** Only generates embeddings for posts that don't already have them
- **Upsert Operations:** Uses efficient database operations to handle both new and updated embeddings
- **Detailed Reporting:** Provides feedback on how many embeddings were found vs. newly created

### LanceDB Vector Database
- **Efficient Storage:** Stores embeddings in LanceDB for fast retrieval
- **Semantic Search:** Find similar content using vector similarity
- **Date Filtering:** Filter search results by date ranges
- **Database Statistics:** Monitor embedding storage and database size

### Date Range Filtering
- **Content Processing:** Filter posts by date range for chunking and embedding
- **Search Filtering:** Apply date filters to semantic search results
- **Flexible Queries:** Support for start date, end date, or both

## Advanced
- The plugin uses a Python backend for chunking/tokenization. If Docling is not available, it falls back to tiktoken/markdownify.
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) settings allow you to use your own data source for context-aware answers.
- LanceDB integration provides efficient vector storage and retrieval for semantic search.
- All settings can be configured in the plugin's settings page.

## Testing
The plugin includes several test files to verify functionality:
- `test-date-filtering.php` - Tests date range filtering
- `test-lancedb.php` - Tests LanceDB integration
- `test-embedding-check.php` - Tests embedding duplicate checking
- `test-separation.php` - Tests chunking service separation
